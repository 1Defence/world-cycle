# World Cycle
Lighter, custom version of world hopper used to hop between a set of worlds circularly

# Example Usage

In this example a player hops between two worlds; 315 and 322 to skip the respawn timer for a quicker ghost task.

Optionally you can enable a panel showing any of the following;
* Current World

  ![DisplayCurrent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dc912b2-f99b-41f5-a778-ab45bb3cd079)

* Next world in cycle

  ![DisplayNext](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d7df8ae-0f2a-46fb-8d33-f70abc45ccb6)


* Previous world in cycle
  
  ![DisplayPrevious](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe38727b-94e1-498b-98a2-56c65ac308bc)


Typically if you use this, you'll only want to have a pair enabled such as current and next.

This is to assist with knowing where you are in cycle and where you'll land when hopping.
